In this project we will write an interactive AI tutorial about Constraint Satisfaction Problems(CSPs). 
We will write it as a Jupyter notebook which implements and explains some of the essential algorithms we have seen in class.

The Jupyter notebook will provide an explanation of the algorithms and related concepts in both Arabic and English, 
and most importantly it has to explain how to implement the algorithms from scratch.
